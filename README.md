Henry Spencer's [regexp.old](https://github.com/garyhouston/regexp.old) lib rewrite to rust, for fun.  

I found Spencer's lib from excellent blog [Implementing Regular Expressions](https://swtch.com/~rsc/regexp/)  of Russ Cox and Zhihu article [如何从零写一个正则表达式引擎？](https://www.zhihu.com/question/27434493/answer/36803124).   


see [lib.rs](https://github.com/Opadc/regex-trivial/blob/main/src/lib.rs) for more information and details of Henry Spencer's lib
